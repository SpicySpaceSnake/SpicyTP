	description="[h1]Spicy's Texture Pack: Core 1.0.0.0[/h1]
is the original resource pack for Noita. It aims to give most of the game a clean and unified aesthetic by way of many visual overhauls in one consistent style, including sleeker UI, more textured materials, redesigned enemies, touched-up pixel scenes, and much more.

Well, it's really [url=https://discord.gg/AJXKqVZrMK]my personal Discord[/url]. But if you hop in and grab yourself a self-assignable role, there's a category that acts as my modding hub.

[h3]This is NOT a texture pack![/h3]
A texture pack, by definition, replaces sprites. Nothing more.
SpicyTP:Core goes beyond that to visually enhance your experience ever further, editing pixel scene terrain maps, changing animation speeds and lengths, [i]removing[/i] certain sprites or adding new animations, and even giving certain things entirely new visual effects.

[h2]What sprites does this mod overhaul?[/h2]
This mod currently supports:
[list]
[*]Vanilla - [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2859751773/3372657164725020666/]NUMBER sprites[/url]
[/list]
...and much more to come.

[h3]Toggles[/h3]
Though I strongly encourage having all sprites on and learning them, toggles exist in case you don't want certain sets. More will be added as needed and coded.

[h2]Is this mod compatible with X?[/h2]
This mod edits several sprite filepaths and overwrites many image files - but it really shouldn't break anything.
However, a Mod X that overrites the same files or edits the same sections of files as SpicyTP may take priority over this mod if Mod X loads after it. Likewise, this mod will take priority over others, though that's beneficial at times due to the nature of a texture pack.

[h2]Will there ever be cross-mod support?[/h2]
[b]Yes![/b] I'm already looking into adding support for other mods (alongside further vanilla content updates).
However, I'm not familiar with every mod out there. If you're the owner of (or somehow affiliated with) a mod that you want me to add support for, consider reaching out to ask!

[h2]How often does this mod update?[/h2]
Updates will likely become somewhat sparse, taking anywhere from 1-3 months; biomes are hefty and large, and I don't want to release incomplete content. There is a [i]small chance[/i] I may release WIP builds before a biome is fully complete, though how exactly I'd do that is something I'm not sure of yet.
In practice, hwoever, this varies; after all, this is merely a hobby project, and other things may take priority over this mod.
