[h1]1.0.1.0: Temple Update 1[/h1]
Uhhh content! Lots! Decided that I'll release periodic WIP updates instead of trying to complete an entire biome before releasing, because this is taking waaay too long and I don't want this to go stale or reach a point where I can't make minor but important updates without doing some unfinished asset juggling.
Includes a decent chunk of Temple-related assets (enemies, materials, other cool stuff), a near-complete Holy Mountain, and a few other objects and projectiles.
Also, there's now a [url=https://github.com/SpicySpaceSnake/SpicyTP]Git repo[/url]! Go there if you want older releases because you don't like incomplete content (eg. current goal is Temple and Lab, whose assets won't be fully completed until 1.1).
