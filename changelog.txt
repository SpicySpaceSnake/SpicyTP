[h1]1.0.1.1: A Slight Hiccup[/h1]
I seem to have forgotten that other mods use the Holy Mountain for important things, and that changing its layout would also affect or potentially break those mods. Whoops!
This is a quick hotfix that disables the HM changes entirely until I sort out conflicts. Sorry for any inconvenience this causes in the meantime.
